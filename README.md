# Russian roulette simulator in various programming languages
---
**WARNING: Very unprofessional/informal project!!!**

Trying to make a russian roulette simulator in many programming languages

I'm going to (try to) use as many features the languages offer as I feel like, even if not strictly necessary (like multiple files or other stuff)

Every language used is going to have its own folder with all the source files inside (e.g. `c/`, `python/`...)

The only purposes for this "project" are to demonstrate the languages, to practice and (most importantly) for personal reference.

Why specifically a russian roulette simulator and not something else? death is fun i guess
